# Genomics Data Analysis Learning Environment

## Overview

This repository provides a fully containerized development environment for the Professional Certificate in Data Analysis for Genomics, specifically designed to support the following Harvard Online courses:

### Courses Covered
* **PH525.5x: Introduction to Bioconductor**
* **PH525.6x: Case Studies in Functional Genomics**
* **PH525.7x: Advanced Bioconductor**

## Key Features

- üß¨ **Comprehensive Genomics Development Environment**
- üê≥ **Docker and DevContainer Support**
- üñ•Ô∏è **Browser-Accessible RStudio**
- üìö **Pre-configured Bioconductor and R Libraries**
- üöÄ **Reproducible Research Setup**

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- (Optional) Visual Studio Code
- (Optional) Remote Containers Extension

## Quick Start

<!-- ### Docker Compose Method -->
```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
Access RStudio at: `http://localhost:8787`
- **Username**: rstudio
- **Password**: rstudio

<!-- ### VSCode DevContainer Method
1. Open project in VSCode
